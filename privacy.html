    <main>
      <p>The <strong>OG Spy</strong> extension does not collect, store, or process any personal data from the user.</p>
      <p>This extension operates entirely within the client environment and does not transmit any information to remote servers or third parties. It does not use cookies, analytics, or any form of tracking mechanisms.</p>
      <p>By installing and using this extension, you acknowledge that no personal information is gathered or processed in any form. This policy is subject to change only in the highly unlikely event of functional overhaul, in which case it will be updated accordingly.</p>
      <p>We do not and will not ever spy on users. That would be ironic.</p>
